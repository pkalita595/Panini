# Panini
We are updating the code, hence delaying code push. Please mail `pkalita@cse.iitk.ac.in` for the current implementation.

## How to run

Benchmarks are inside `benchmark` directory.

Copy the content of a single benchmark in the `src/input/` to run. 

```
cd src
cp -r ../benchmarks/b1/* input/
```

Now run the `run.sh` file to run Panini with benchmark `b1`.

```
bash run.sh
```

Synthesized solutions will be inside `synthesized_sols` directory.
